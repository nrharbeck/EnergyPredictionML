1,50,"<p>Texas has many policies promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. The state has energy efficiency goals and requirements for various types of public and publicly supported entities. Texas also adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard early in 1999 and has already surpassed the goal set for 2025 due to the excellent wind resource in the state. Texas is one of the top states in total wind power generation, and it continues encouraging the development of wind energy throughout the state. </p>","<p>Texas has restructured its electricity portfolio, partially due to the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) adopted in 1999. The RPS encourages Texas to take advantage of the state's wind resource, which is abundant. In 2001, the Texas legislature enacted public building energy efficiency standards to help the state comply with federal Clean Air Act requirements. In the same year, the Texas Public Utility Commission established a renewable energy credit (REC) trading program to ensure compliance with the RPS. </p><p>From 2001 to 2002, wind energy developed quickly, reaching 900 megawatts in total capacity<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>. To support the development of renewable energy throughout the state, Texas decided to expand transmission infrastructure. In 2005, Texas passed the <a href=""https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/SDocs/UTILITIESCODE.pdf"">Texas Utilities Code</a> to designate Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) in the state. The CREZ policy allowed new transmission to be built to wind-rich areas before interconnection commitments were signed with specific developers<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>. </p>","<p>Texas first adopted the <a href=""http://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/rulesnlaws/subrules/electric/25.173/25.173ei.aspx"">Renewable Portfolio Standard</a> (RPS) in 1999, setting  a rule called the Goal for Renewable Energy. The RPS requires the state to install 5,000 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity by 2015 and sets a target of 10,000 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2025. The RPS applies to all retail entities in Texas, and the share of the mandate for each entity is determined by that retailer's pro rata share of statewide retail energy sales. </p><p>As stated in the annual compliance report prepared by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Texas had already reached the 2025 goal in 2009 and had 26,045 MW of additional renewable energy capacity (24,381MW of which was wind) in 2017 relative to 1999.</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/about/mission.aspx"">Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT)</a> was created in 1975 by the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA).

The ICC is made up of a board of five members who are all appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate for five-year terms. One of these members is designated Chairman by the Governor.</p><p>Another important renewable energy organization active in the state of Illinois is the Illinois Environmental Council (IEC). According to IEC's website, the organization “serves as the environmental community's eyes, ears, and voice in Springfield.” Originally founded in 1975, the IEC has grown to represent 80 different organizations throughout Illinois.</p><p>Another important renewable energy organization in the state is the Illinois Power Agency (IPA). The IPA was established by the Illinois Power Agency Act in 2007. Since its inception, the IPA has worked to develop plans for the safe and reliable procurement of electricity, conduct competitive processes for energy procurement, develop a procurement plan for renewable resources in the long term, and more.</p><p>Another important organization in furthering renewable energy and energy efficiency in Illinois is the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), founded in 2001. MISO is one of the largest ISOs in the world, with over $29 billion in gross market energy transactions annually. MISO operates across fifteen US states and the Manitoba province in Canada. MISO operates in the majority of Illinois. The part of Illinois not covered by MISO is covered by PJM. MISO's cornerstones are customer service, effective communication, and operational excellence.

3,38,"<p>The state of North Carolina has many programs for renewable energy and energy efficiency, which exist across a wide range of technology types and are available for utility-scale, commercial, and residential customers. In terms of installed solar generating capacity, North Carolina ranks second in the United States (second to California).</p>","<p>Historically, North Carolina has largely depended upon other states for its energy needs. This is because North Carolina does not have reserves of coal, natural gas, or uranium. The financial drawbacks of relying upon other states for energy needs has made renewable energy an appealing option in North Carolina. In 1978, Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) as part of the National Energy Act. PURPA requires utilities to purchase power at the rate of the utility's avoided cost from qualifying facilities. This act was federally mandated, but many aspects were left up to individual states, such as the calculation of avoided cost and the capacity thresholds. As opposed to other states, North Carolina set longer contract terms and higher capacity thresholds. This allowed renewables to grow considerably in the state.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup></p><p>Solar energy in particular has grown immensely in recent years, thanks in part to North Carolina's Renewable Portfolio Standard (passed in 2007), propelling North Carolina to becoming a leader in utility-scale solar, currently ranking second only to California in installed generating capacity.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> North Carolina also had a generous tax credit for renewable energy for many years, which expired on January 1, 2016.  In 2017, North Carolina passed House Bill 589, which was the first bipartisan comprehensive piece of energy legislation in North Carolina in a decade. This bill added competitive bidding for solar developers, a solar rooftop leasing program operating statewide, a community solar program, and the Green Source Rider Program, which enables large utilities to offset their electricity use with renewable sources.<sup><sup>3</sup></sup></p><p>North Carolina also has potential for wind power generation, especially in the eastern part of the state and offshore. Currently, the interpretation of the 1983 Ridge Law prohibits wind farms from being placed on mountaintops in western North Carolina.<sup><sup>4</sup></sup></p>","<p>When Senate Bill 3 passed on August 20, 2007, North Carolina became the first Southeastern state to adopt a Renewable Portfolio Standard. North Carolina's Renewable Portfolio Standard stipulates that 12.5% of energy sold by the state's investor-owned utilities must come from renewable sources or energy efficiency measures by 2021. Municipal utilities and electric cooperatives are required to meet a target of 10% by 2018 and are governed by slightly different rules than investor-owned utilities.</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://deq.nc.gov/energy-climate/energy-group/state-energy-program"">State Energy Program</a>, a division of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, runs several programs to address energy issues in the state.

In 2008, New York created its Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard, which was aimed at creating programs and incentives to reduce electricity usage in the state. Also in 2008, New York joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) along with eight other Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. The RGGI became the US's first mandatory, market-based effort to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> In 2014, NY Green Bank was established as a specialized entity within NYSERDA, and was aimed at increasing private investment in renewable energy. Governor Cuomo launched his ambitious Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) program in the same year, which would grow to define energy policy in the State of New York. The 2015 State Energy Plan was created as a roadmap for accomplishing Governor Cuomo's vision.<sup><sup>3</sup></sup> During the same year, the Clean Energy Standard was enacted under the direction of the governor, which expanded New York's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). </p>","<p>New York's Renewable Portfolio Standard was first created and introduced in 2004. In 2016, it was expanded by Governor Cuomo's Clean Energy Standard (CES). The CES contains the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. New York's current RPS calls for 50% of New York's energy to come from renewable sources by 2030, although Governor Cuomo has proposed to expand that goal to 70%. In order to accomplish these goals, New York has created a Renewable Energy Standard (RES) and a Zero-Emissions credit (ZEC) requirement. New York's RPS supports three kinds of projects: the construction of new renewables, the preservation of existing renewables, and the maintenance of existing safely operating nuclear power plants. The Clean Energy Standard was expanded again in October 2020 following passage of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act in 2019.<sup><sup>4</sup></sup> </p>","<p>NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority) is one of the most important renewable energy organizations in the State of New York.

6,40,"<p>The state of Ohio offers a variety of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs across a wide range of technology types. Programs are available for residential, commercial, and utility-scale customers.</p>","<p>In 1999, Ohio passed legislation that restructured its electric industry. As a part of that restructuring, Ohio's original net metering law was passed. At first, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) required that utilities credit net excess generation to customers at the utility's full retail rate. In 2002, this exchange was declared illegal by the Ohio Supreme Court and the requirement changed to the utility's unbundled generation rate. PUCO further amended its rules in 2007, and in 2008, S.B. 221 further amended those rules by placing a limit on net metering whenever the total rated generating capacity used by customer-generators is less than one percent of the provider's aggregate customer peak demand in Ohio. In November of 2017, PUCO created new amendments to the state's net metering rules. These new rules, among other things, set a maximum system size limit at 120% of a customer's average yearly usage.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup></p>","<p>In May of 2008, the state of Ohio enacted broad legislation aimed at restructuring the electric industry (S.B. 221). As a part of this legislation, Ohio created the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS). The AEPS applies to all retail electricity providers except for cooperatives and municipal utilities. The AEPS requires 25% of the state's annual energy supply to come from alternative energy sources, with half of that (12.5%) coming specifically from renewables. The AEPS also includes a solar carve-out which sets a solar target of 0.5% of the state's electricity supply by 2026. S.B. 221 also required utilities to implement peak demand reduction and energy efficiency programs that save 22% by the end of 2025 and reduce peak demand by 1% in 2009 and 0.75% for every year beyond that through 2018. In 2014, the Ohio state legislature passed S.B. 310, and in doing so became the first state to freeze its renewable portfolio standard. The AEPS remained frozen until the beginning of 2017, when it resumed its original schedule again.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> The AEPS was scaled back by new legislation passed in 2019.<sup><sup>3</sup></sup>  </p>","<p>One important organization in advancing the future of renewable energy and energy efficiency in the state of Ohio is the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO). PUCO was initially founded in 1911 by the state legislature to address public concerns outside the field of railroads (a railroad commission already existed at the time). Originally, PUCO had jurisdiction over gas, electric telephone, and water companies. Over time, PUCO's jurisdiction would expand to buses, transportation of property, and wastewater. PUCO is led by five commissioners on rotating, five-year terms. A seat becomes open every year and any Ohioan who is not employed by and has no financial interest in any particular utility can apply for the position. A PUCO nominating council sends a list of names to the governor, who then appoints the new commissioner. PUCO works to ensure that safe, reliable, adequate, and affordable utility services are available to all residents and businesses, and its actions affect nearly every household in the state.</p><p>Another important organization in Ohio is PJM Interconnection Association. PJM is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that serves customers in fifteen states as well as the District of Columbia. PJM originally began in 1927 when three utilities formed the first continuing power pool in the world. Additional utilities would join that pool in 1956, 1965, and 1981. In 1997, PJM became fully independent and membership was extended to non-utilities. During that year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved PJM as the first fully functional independent system operator in the United States. Later, in 2002, PJM became the first fully functioning RTO in the nation. PJM is lead by an independent board of ten members who must abide by a strict code of conduct in order to ensure their neutrality. The primary task of PJM is to ensure that the bulk electric power system is secure, safe, and reliable.</p><p>Utilities are also major players in advancing the future of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Ohio.

7,18,"<p>The state of Indiana offers many renewable energy and energy efficiency programs across a wide range of technology types. These programs are available for commercial, residential, and utility-scale customers.</p>","<p>In September of 2004, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission enacted rules for net metering which required the investor-owned utilities in the state to offer net metering to all electric customers. In May of 2017, Senate Bill 309 made changes to the net metering system, including an eventual phase-out of retail rate net metering. This will occur by July 1, 2022 or when specific utilities reach 1.5% peak summer load caps. Customers with contracts before December of 2017 can continue their contracts until July 1, 2047, and those who sign up before the phase-out can continue their contracts until July 1, 2032.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup></p>","<p>Indiana's Clean Energy Portfolio Standard (CPS), also known as the Comprehensive Hoosier Option to Incentivize Cleaner Energy (CHOICE) program was enacted in May of 2011 with S.B. 251. This program is voluntary and sets a goal of 10% clean energy by 2025. Participating utilities receive incentives to increase their energy production from renewable energy. Indiana's CPS allows up to 30% of the goal to be met with “clean coal” technology, combined heat and power, nuclear energy, natural gas that displaces electricity from coal, or net-metered distribution generation facilities. At least fifty percent of energy going towards the goal must be produced within Indiana.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></p>","<p>One important organization in the state of Indiana is the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission was initially founded as the Railroad Commission in the late 19th century. In 1913, the Railroad Commission became the Public Service Commission as it gained regulatory authority over natural gas, water, electric, trucking, and telephone services. In 1987, it changed its name again to become the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Today, the Commission no longer regulates trucking, but does oversee more than 600 Indiana utilities. The Commission does not provide advocacy for either the public or utilities, but instead makes all of its decisions in the public interest and ensures that utilities in the state provide service that is safe, reliable, and affordable. The Commission is headed by five commissioners who are appointed by the governor, and has a total professional staff of approximately 75 people.<sup><sup>3</sup></sup></p><p>Another important organization in Indiana is the Indiana Office of Energy Development (OED), which was created to shepherd Indiana's energy plan. OED works to develop and implement comprehensive energy planning for the state that takes advantage of all of the resources Indiana has to offer and supports a growing, dynamic, and strong economy. OED also administers Department of Energy grant programs within the state. These programs promote energy efficiency, alternative power and fuels, and public education on energy issues.<sup><sup>4</sup></sup></p><p>The Indiana Energy Association (IEA) is another important organization in the state of Indiana. IEA is an association of natural gas and electric power companies dedicated to providing Indiana consumers with energy that is affordable and reliable. The utilities that are a part of the IEA provide service to over four million Hoosiers. The IEA has ensured that families and businesses save money by keeping rates below the national average. Also, since the year 2000, harmful emissions have been significantly reduced in Indiana, thanks in large part to the Indiana Energy Association. Since that year, carbon dioxide emissions have gone down 22%, sulfur dioxide has gone down 69%, and nitrogen dioxide has gone down 70%.<sup><sup>5</sup></sup></p><p>The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), founded in 2001, is another important organization in Indiana furthering renewable energy and energy efficiency. MISO is among the largest ISOs in the world, with over $29 billion in gross market energy transactions annually. MISO operates across fifteen US states and the Canadian province of Manitoba, including the majority of Indiana. The part of Indiana not covered by MISO is covered by PJM. MISO's cornerstones are customer service, operational excellence, and effective communication. MISO is led by an independent Board of Directors who are elected by the members of the organization and serve three-year terms. Members of the Board of Directors are also required to meet certain qualifications designed to ensure that MISO is led by a capable board.<sup><sup>6</sup></sup></p><p>Utilities also play an important role in furthering energy efficiency and renewable energy in Indiana.

In 2017, Maryland established a tax credit program for energy storage, becoming the first state to do so.<sup><sup>3</sup></sup></p>","<p>Maryland first passed its Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard in May of 2004, and has since revised it numerous times. In 2017, state legislators voted to override a veto by Governor Hogan, which enacted HB 1106. This new law increased the state's RPS requirement from its previous 20% by 2020 to its current 25% by 2020. In 2019, Maryland increased its RPS to 50% by 2030. The state of Maryland has also created carve-outs for solar and offshore wind to help further these technologies.<sup><sup>4</sup></sup></p>","<p>One important organization in the state of Maryland is the Maryland Public Service Commission (Maryland PSC). Maryland PSC was originally established in 1910 by the Maryland General Assembly with the purpose of regulating public utilities and a few passenger transportation companies. Later, the responsibilities of Maryland PSC would expand to include other types of public service companies, including telecommunications, water, railroad, and taxicab companies. Maryland PSC's mission is the ensure that safe, economic, and reliable public utility and transportation services are provided to all the residents of Maryland.</p><p>Another important organization active in promoting environmental sustainability and renewable energy in the state of Maryland is the Maryland Office of People's Counsel (Maryland OPC), whose mission is to represent the interests of residential customers of natural gas, telecommunications, electricity, water, and select transportation industries in the state. Originally created in 1924, Maryland OPC is the oldest organization of its kind in the United States. Maryland OPC is a state agency, but works independently to represent consumers. Maryland OPC has a staff of 19 and retains a range of expert consultants in order to better represent the people of Maryland.</p><p>The Maryland Department of the Environment is another important renewable energy organization in the state. The Maryland Department of the Environment was created in 1987 to safeguard environment health of Maryland's citizens, conduct research and provide long-term planning for the state, protect and preserve the state's land, air, and water, and to enforce environmental legislation. Additionally, the Maryland Department of the Environment provides communities and industries with technical assistance regarding pollution prevention and other environmental issues. The Department's core values are integration of different programs, innovation, science and technology, performance, partnership with the public and private sectors, service, and employee well-being.</p><p>Another important energy organization in the state of Maryland is the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA). MEA aims to promote reliable, affordable, and clean energy in the state of Maryland. MEA does this by advising the Governor and General Assembly on matters relating to energy policy. Additionally, MEA administers residential, commercial, agricultural, and transportation grants and loans to encourage the development of clean energy in Maryland.</p><p>Utilities are also important organizations in furthering renewable energy and energy efficiency in Maryland. The state has four major utilities. One of these four is Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE), which provides gas and electric service to most of central Maryland. Another of these is Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO), which provides service to most of Montgomery County and Prince George's County, as well as in the District of Columbia. Another is Delmarva Power, which provides electric service in the Lower and Upper Eastern Shore. Delmarva Power and PEPCO are affiliates. The last of these four is Potomac Edison Company, which provides service to Frederick, Washington, and Allegheny Counties, as well as parts of Carroll, Howard, and Montgomery Counties.

Wind Capital Group in Gentry County developed Missouri's first utility scale wind farm in early 2007. It had a capacity to generate 57 MW of power. Since then, Missouri has seen the construction of several more wind farms, mostly in northwest counties. As of the end of 2018, Missouri has 500 total wind turbines which generate approximately 1,000 MW of power.<sup><sup>1</sup></sup></p><p>A significant portion of Missouri's energy comes from hydropower as well. The Missouri River currently supports 36 hydropower units via dams along its length. These dams provide about 10 million MWh of energy per year. Missouri is home to the largest roller-compacted concrete dam in North America, namely Ameren's Taum Sauk plant, which was completed in 1963.</p><p>Missouri also has tremendous potential for solar power generation. The Optimal Deployment of Solar Index rated Missouri the fourth most optimal state for solar power in 2010. From 2009 through 2012, solar generating capacity in the state of Missouri increased by over 7,000%, from 101 kW to 7.8 MW. The first utility-scale solar electric installation in Missouri, the Butler Solar Energy Farm, was completed in 2013 and generates 3.05 MW of power. </p>","<p>Missouri voters in 2008 approved the Missouri Clean Energy Act, also known as Proposition C, by a ballot initiative. The Missouri Clean Energy Act repealed the voluntary renewable energy and energy efficiency objective that had existed previously and replaced it with a mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Missouri's RPS mandates that investor owned utilities in the state use eligible renewable energy technologies to meet 15% of their yearly retail sales by 2021. Eligible technologies include solar thermal, photovoltaics, wind, biogas from agricultural operations, landfills, small hydropower, biomass, fuel cells using hydrogen from renewable sources, wastewater treatment plants, pyrolysis and thermal depolymerization of waste materials, and other resources as approved by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.<sup><sup>2</sup></sup></p>","<p>One important organization advancing the future of energy in Missouri is the Missouri Public Service Commission (Missouri PSC). The Missouri PSC regulates investor-owned utilities in the state, and has some control over telecommunication providers as well. The Missouri PSC is led by a board of five commissioners, who are appointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate. The Missouri PSC works to regulate natural gas, electric, water, steam, and sewer utilities in a way that ensures safe and reliable services to all Missourians.</p><p>Another important Missouri organization is the Division of Energy within the Department of Economic Development. The Division of Energy encourages, educates, and assists Missourians to use energy efficient resources efficiently. The Division of energy looks to ensure affordability, diversify and promote security in supply, promote efficiency of use, undertake regulatory improvements, and stimulate innovation and job creation.</p><p>Another important organization in Missouri is the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), founded in 2001.

25,15,"<p>Hawaii offers a variety of incentive programs to encourage the adoption of renewable energy and the improvement of energy efficiency by commercial, residential and governmental energy consumers. Hawaii has a relatively large amount of renewable energy generation and was the first state to adopt a 100% renewable energy goal. Hawaii's clean energy goals include obtaining 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2045 and reducing electricity consumption 40% by 2030.</p>","<p>To reach its renewable goal, Hawaii enacted legislation in 2008 which requires solar water heaters to be installed on new single-family residential construction<sup><sup>1</sup></sup>. Though Hawaii's net metering program is seen as a key driver of solar penetration surging, it was closed to new applicants in 2015. Instead, there are two distributed generation tariffs, namely Customer Grid Supply Plus (CGS Plus) and Smart Export. The CGS Plus is available for residential and small commercial customers, and the Smart Export is for customers who own renewable energy plus energy storage systems. Customers will receive a monthly bill credit for energy delivered to the grid based on an island-specific rate<sup><sup>2</sup></sup>. </p><p>In 2006, Hawaii enacted legislation to create a public benefits fund (PBF), funded by a surcharge on utility bills that is based on a percentage of total utility revenue. In 2009, Hawaii Energy was created to administrate the public benefits funds, which aims to reduce energy consumption, improve energy efficiency, and pursue a 100% clean energy future<sup><sup>3</sup></sup>. In 2015, Hawaii established a separate Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) to reduce electricity consumption by 4,300 GWh (40% of 2007 electricity) by 2030<sup><sup>4</sup></sup>. </p><p>To reduce its heavy dependence on petroleum, Hawaii has been developing its abundant renewable energy resources. The largest source of renewable energy in Hawaii is solar power with a total of 1225.25 MW installed capacity; this provides more than half of the state's total renewable generation, and more than 10% of the state's total electricity generation<sup><sup>5</sup></sup>. Most of this solar generation comes from distributed PV systems due to tax credits, incentives, and utilities' distributed energy resource programs. Wind energy is Hawaii's second most utilized renewable energy, accounting for more than 20% of the state's renewable generation. The state's first wind farm was built in the 1980's by Hawaiian Electric Company in Kahuku, Oahu. Currently there are eight existing utility-scale wind energy projects in Hawaii located on the islands of Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii. The remaining renewable generation is provided by bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, and ocean-based power<sup><sup>6</sup></sup>.</p>","<p>Hawaii established a renewable portfolio goal in 2001, requiring each electric utility to set goals to increase net renewable energy sales to 9% by December 31, 2010. This goal was replaced with an enforceable renewable portfolio standard (RPS) upon the enactment of S.B. 2474 in 2004, raising the target to 10% and requiring that 20% of electricity be generated from renewable resources by the end of 2020. In 2015, the Hawaii legislature amended the state's RPS (H.B. 623) and Hawaii became the first state to establish a legislative goal: obtaining 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2045.

In 2019, the Commission regulates 1,806 entities to provide effective and informed oversight so as to serve the public fairly and reliably. Among these regulated entities, there are four electric utilities, including Hawaiian Electric Company, Manu Electric Company, Hawaii Electric Light Company, and Kauai Island Utility Cooperative<sup><sup>8</sup></sup>.

HCEI has made progress through policy that the state's renewable energy portfolio and energy efficiency targets have been codified into law. In the clean transportation sector, there are over 5,000 EVs in Hawaii, supported by over 530 publicly available charging stations statewide. In renewable energy deployment, HCEI is investing in smart infrastructure and exploring next generation technologies<sup><sup>11</sup></sup>. </p><p>Utilities in Hawaii also play a significant role in advancing renewable energy and energy efficiency.
